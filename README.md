=> This is a practice website where I experimented with Axios to perform both POST and GET requests from APIs. 
   For this, I created two different mock APIs on MockAPI.io â€“ one for users and one for admins.

=> In this project, I also installed and used Tailwind CSS. From my personal experience, I realized something important:
   beginners often make the mistake of skipping normal CSS and jumping directly into Tailwind or other frameworks.
   But without a strong foundation in basic CSS, it becomes harder to fully enjoy and understand advanced tools.

=> Additionally, in this website I practiced using React Router (latest routing setup) and explored navigation using
   the useNavigate() hook to redirect between pages.
